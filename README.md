# dotfiles
All files are usable, in use and up-to-date!

Check out the [installationguide](https://github.com/nonator/dotfiles/blob/master/install_tmux.md) for `TMUX` without the need to be `root`.

## usage
The Makefile uses `stow`.
The directories `laptop`, `mac`, `vollmond` only differ in a few configs, but
are mostly the same.
This will be changed any time.
Old dotfiles have to be deleted or backed up.
For me it is enough to `make` in a terminal.
