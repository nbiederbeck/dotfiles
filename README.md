### todo
- [ ] Makefile
  - a Makefile should backup all old dotfiles !
  - then symlink or (maybe better?) copy the new ones in place
    - [ ] check out GNU stow !
    - maybe two different approaches, one for contributors, one for users (!)
  - (maybe revoke the whole process to use old dotfiles again, to make a super easy switch)
  - (maybe a functionality (with configfile) to copy/symlink only a handful of files)

# dotfiles
All files are usable, in use and up-to-date!

Check out the [installationguide](https://github.com/nonator/dotfiles/blob/master/install_tmux.md) for `TMUX` without the need to be `root`.
