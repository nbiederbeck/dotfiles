help="HELP:

This script sets the sensitivity of my RÃ˜DE microphone.  There are two
settings, one for much talking (and typing), where the microphone is
near the mouth.  The other setting is mostly for when I have not much
to say (or do not type at all), the microphone turned away.

USAGE:

./mic.sh talk|near
./mic.sh listen|far
